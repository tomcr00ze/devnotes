This blog is a series of notes I took from watching developer talks and conferences, usually those that I could watch from youtube. That is all.

Because I created this github account right after seeing Top Gun Maverick (ofc in its full glory in IMAX), and Tom Cruise is <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/g-o-a-t/">the GOAT</a>. That movie and Cruise's latest movies made me think of pursuing the lifetime pursuit of mastering one's own craft just like Cruise did, and so I built this new github account, which would be a place for me to dump the things i'm learning and track my journey as a software craftsman.
